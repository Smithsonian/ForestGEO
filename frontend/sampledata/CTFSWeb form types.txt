- dbh --> CoreMeasurements.Measurement, (many-to-many relationship with MeasurementTypes such that (MeasurementTypeID, MeasurementTypeDescription) = (1, 'DBH') and CoreMeasurements.MeasurementTypeID = 1 (foreign key reference to MeasurementTypes)) and dbh must be converted to string before populating CoreMeasurements.Measurement
- codes --> Attributes.Code (many to many relationship with Attributes and CMAttributes such that for each code listed in codes, a new reference between Attributes and the respective CoreMeasurement row needs to be created in CMAttributes)
