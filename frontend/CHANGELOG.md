# Version history and list

1. Acacia
   The Acacia version is the first formal iteration of the application. The ForestGEO application is intended to act as
   a replacement and improvement to the CTFSWeb application. Depending on assigned permissions, users can add all
   CTFSWeb-developed data types (codes, quadrats, personnel, species, census) and run validations against uploaded
   census data.
