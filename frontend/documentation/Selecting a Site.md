### Selecting a site will change the core schema you are connecting to in the Azure MySQL server

> [!tip]
> This will trigger an app refresh/reset! Please make sure you save your changes before you attempt to change sites.

#### When you click on the site dropdown, you should see something like this:

![[site selection dropdown.png|300]]

##### Important notes:

1. Allowed sites: There are a limited subset of site(s) that you will be given access to. Please contact an
   administrator if you do not have access to a website you need.
2. Other Sites: This is intended to give you a view of all available sites, so that you can get access to a site if it
   becomes necessary.
3. Site Deselect: This is intended as a failsafe and will clear local data.

### Once you select a site, a loading icon will appear, and the view of the sidebar should change:

> [!tip]
> Please note the indicated schema -- this is intended to help debug any issues -- having a schema name to reference
> directly will speed up the process a little as we won't have to search for the schema name corresponding to the site.
