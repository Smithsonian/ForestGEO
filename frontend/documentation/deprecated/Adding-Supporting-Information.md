# Adding Supporting Information

## Understanding the Navigation Menu's Badges

After you've selected an existing census (or created a new one), the navigation menu will update
to indicate if you're **missing any supporting data**

> If you have missing supporting data, you'll need to add it before you can submit core data!

If you hover your mouse over the red badges, you should see a clarifying tip message appear!

You should also see that the View Data navigation link in the Census Hub menu is **disabled**
and has a tip message:

The next set of documentation steps will follow the order of the navigation menu buttons in the
sidebar!
