### The way the census is structured in this app is a little more complicated:

![[census dropdown.png|300]]
There are a few important things to note here, so let's use the ==Census 3== selection as a template to explain how the
census selection has been updated.
![[census 3.png|300]]  
**Census 3** denotes the Plot Census Number of the census
This refers to the overall census being completed for the referenced plot
As such, this denotes the **third** census being completed for the plot **SCBI**

We'll move from the bottom up:
As you can see, the date ranges visible for this census are organized chronologically in descending order (newest range
first)

![[census 3 older.png|300]]  
This references the first date range for this plot census number where measurements were collected.

> Censuses should not be edited once they're completed!  
> If you need to correct a census (by plot census number):
>
> - You should create a new date range (**opening and then closing the census**) and add your updated information.
> - If duplicates exist for your data across different censuses, they will be highlighted as such and should be ignored.

Correspondingly, this references the next date range of measurement collection for that census.

### Censuses must be closed before new censuses can be open

### Censuses must be open when making modifications

Once you've picked all three, you should see the following:
