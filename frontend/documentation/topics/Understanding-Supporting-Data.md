# Understanding Supporting Data

Supporting data is descriptive information that needs to be added before you can submit any 
measurements. 

## What is Supporting Data?

There are four types of supporting data that are **required** before any measurements can be 
submitted:
1. Stem Codes
2. Personnel
3. Quadrats
4. Species

### Stem Codes

These are attributes that can be assigned to a stem, and are subdivided into seven **statuses**:
- alive
- alive-not measured
- dead
- stem dead
- broken below
- omitted
- missing

When you add a new stem code, you must specify a **unique** code, a description of the attribute 
being represented, and a status from the aforementioned list. 

### Personnel (and Roles)

Personnel are the people who are involved in the collection of data. They are assigned by census 
and can be assigned a role depending on their involvement. If their role is not present, you can 
create it by clicking ont the **Roles** button, which will open a popup with a new table. 

### Quadrats

Quadrats are the smallest **recorded** region of measurement in a plot. They record starting 
coordinates (and their units of measure), their dimensions (and their units of measure),  
their area (and its units of measure), and their rough shape (square, rectangular, circular, etc.)

### Species

The taxonomic information for the stems being measured. This can range from as broad as the 
family designation, or as specific as the subspecies designation. However, at a minimum, the 
species must be specified.
