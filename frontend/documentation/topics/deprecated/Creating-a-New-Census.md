# Creating a New Census

Before you get started with adding recorded data, you **might** need to create a new census!

To create a new census, open the `Select a Census` selection dropdown and click on the
`Add New Census` button.

This will open the Rollover Modal (a popup)â€”which you can use to copy over existing data from
another
census or create a new census from scratch.

> What data can I copy over?
>
> Some data is census-dependent! Personnel and Quadrats tend not to change (or only change
> slightly) between censuses, so you can copy over that data if you'd like.
>
> Additionally, you can also customize what data you want to copy over!
> After you select a census to copy data over from, click on the checkbox labeled
> `Roll over ... data` and then the `Customize ... selection` button to open a grid display of
> the data to be copied over.
> You can then check/uncheck data you'd like to include/exclude!

After you decide whether to roll over data, click on the Confirm button in the bottom right
corner of the popup to complete the process.

The site should reload, and you should be able to see your new census in the dropdown!
