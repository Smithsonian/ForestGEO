# Submitting Form Data

- Before you can submit new measurements for a census, you'll need to submit some supporting data
  needed to make sure that your measurements are correctly correlated to the right location,
  plant, or time period.
  This supporting data makes up the navigation links under the Stem & Plot Details navigation
  menu.

    - Stem Codes:
        - Attribute information for a stem
        - Allows you to add characteristics like 'alive,' 'dead,' 'missing,' etc. to a stem.
          This becomes important laterâ€”it's important to make sure you don't accidentally mark a stem as
          dead when it's not!
    - Personnel:
        - Who's working on the plot?
        - This data is organized on a census-by-census basis, so you can clearly see who was working on
          the plot at what
          time.
        - You can also assign a role to a person, which can include anything from 'plot supervisor' to
          'field technician' to 'volunteer'!
    - Quadrats:
        - This is a more granular system to subdivide the plot. Each plot can be massive, but dividing
          it into quadrats
          can make it easier to keep track of each stem.
        - Quadrats, like personnel, are also organized on a census-by-census basis, so you can get a
          better idea of how
          the plot was divided for a particular census.
    - Species List:
        - Species information for all stems in the plot.
        - This is a dedicated list of the different species designations assigned to stems in the plot.
    - Plot-Species List:
        - This is a special case! This is a list of all species listed in the plot, but filtered by
          stems physically
          located in the plot. It's always possible that species in a plot come and go as environmental
          conditions
          change, so this is a way to take a look at species assignments specifically at the place and
          time you're
          working with. You shouldn't need to modify or add to this view -- it should be used for
          reference only!
