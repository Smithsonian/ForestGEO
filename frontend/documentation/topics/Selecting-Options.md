# Selecting Options

Before you can properly access the website, you will need to **use the left-hand sidebar** to 
select:
1. A site
2. A plot
3. A census (if you need to start a new census, click on the Add New Census button!)


Once you select all of these, you will be redirected to the dashboard page, and a new interface 
will appear.

## Understanding Sites, Plots, and Census

### What is a site?

A site describes an overall collection of plots in the same geographic location, and further sets 
a series of default parameters for the plots in that site:

- Subquadrat dimensions—sites are subdivided as follows: a site is a collection of plots, and a 
  plot is a collection of **quadrats**
- Double data entry—sites can be set to require double data entry. When this is enabled, 
  measurements must be recorded **twice** for each **quadrat**, and will be held in temporary 
  storage until an administrator reviews both sets of data and approves a single merged set. 

### What is a plot?

A plot describes a specific region within a site being sampled, and is used to further 
determine the overall coordinates of sampled stems within the plot. 

### What is a census?

A census describes a date range for which sampled data is collected. This date range can vary 
and is not a fixed interval. It is defined by the first and last measurements taken 
during the sampling range.
