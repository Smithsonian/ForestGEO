# Before Using the Website/Logging In

## Moving Through this Documentation

This documentation site is intended to help get you started with using the ForestGEO app!
It is written as a step-by-step guide that you can follow to get a comprehensive understanding
of the process of using the ForestGEO website.
At the bottom of each page, you will see a navigation link pointing to the "next" page.
Use it to move to the next stage!

## Introduction

Before you're ready to start using ForestGEO, you'll need to make sure that you have the following:

1. A registered account on the SIOCIORC tenant (Any non-SI email account that's been invited to the
   SIOCIORC tenant)
2. A registered account on the ForestGEO server (A user entry created for the same email in the
   ForestGEO MySQL server)

> Missing one of these? Please contact an administrator to request access!

> I keep hearing about a **development website**â€”what's that?

> > The development site is used to test features or fixes that have been completed locally but
> > not yet tested in the Azure environment.
> > It's not intended for use by users, and is intended
