# Getting Started

Welcome to the ForestGEO Data Processing Application!

## Logging In

Before you can log in, you must complete the following (if you haven't already):

- You must create a Microsoft (non-SI) account, and an administrator must invite you to the Smithsonian Research
  Computing tenant. From here, your account will be added to the ForestGEO app server, and you should be able to log in
  once then.

> Currently, this is a stopgap measure. We are working on a solution to allow for ForestGEO users to log in with
> their SI credentials.

## Using the Application

### Customizing Your Plot

After you log in, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. A sidebar on the left side of the window should appear, with
dropdowns to select a **Site**. It should look something like this:
![site-dropdown.png](site-dropdown.png){ style="inline"}

Once you've selected a site, you'll be able to select a **Plot**, looking something like this:
![plot-dropdown.png](plot-dropdown.png) {style="inline"}

> Please note - the plot you'll first see is a **placeholder**! Please use the ellipsis button to open the customization
> popup: ![plot-edit-button.png](plot-edit-button.png) {style="inline"}

#### Plot Customization Popup

Use this to customize your plot! After saving, your selections will reset and the site will update itself. Please ensure
your edits are visible when you attempt to select the plot again!

### Creating a Census

This app operates along the following **core concepts**:

1. **Site**: A site is a collection of plots.
2. **Plot**: A plot is a geographic region marked for data collection
3. **Census**: A census is a **date range** denoting a distinct time period where data was collected in the **Plot**

With this in mind, you will need to create a census before you can begin entering data. After opening the Census
dropdown, click on the Add New Census button to open the Census Creation popup:
