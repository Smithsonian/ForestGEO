# Getting Started!

## Introduction

Before you're ready to start using ForestGEO, you'll need to make sure that you have the following:

1. A registered account on the SI tenant.
2. A registered account on the ForestGEO server, and:
    1. **at least one site registered to your account in-server.**

> Missing one of these? Please contact an administrator to request access!

## Logging In

Once you've gotten both of these set up, you can access the ForestGEO website by visiting one of the
two following URLs:

| Production                                                      | Development                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Production URL](https://forestgeo-livesite.azurewebsites.net/) | [Development URL](https://forestgeo-livesite-development.azurewebsites.net/) |

> Which website should I use?
>
> > If you want to use the most recent fully stabilized version, use the production website.
> > {style="warning"}
>
> > If you want to test out the latest features, use the development website.
> > {style="warning"}

> Or try both! Either way, any and all feedback you can provide is greatly appreciated!
> {style="note"}

Once you decide which website to use, you can use the _Login_ icon in the **bottom right corner** of
the sidebar to log
in! Follow the Microsoft prompts to complete the login process.

> Remember, if you don't have any sites assigned to your account, you won't be able to complete the
> login process!
> {style="warning"}

Once you've logged in, you'll be redirected to the **Dashboard** page.
