# Understanding the Dashboard

## First look

The dashboard is the first page you'll see when you log in to the ForestGEO website. It contains a
few key pieces of
information that should help guide you through the process of working with this application.

### Core Functions and Features

Once you've logged in, the left-hand side of the dashboard should contain a card with a list of core
instructions and requirements.
Please review these carefully!
They're critical to ensuring that you're able to use the website properly.

They're listed here again with some more information to better explain what they mean:

> The navigation menu will not become clickable until you have selected a site, plot, and census.

> This is done to ensure that you can only see the data that you're allowed to see!
>
> It's important to make sure that you don't accidentally make changes to data that's historical
> or in the wrong place!

- You will need to submit supporting data before being able to submit new measurements for your
  census.

### User-Specific Information

To the right of the core instructions and requirements, you'll see a card with a list of
user-specific information.
This includes:

- The role you've been assigned
- The sites you have access to
- The email address associated with your account

> Anything wrong, missing, or unclear?
> Please use the **question mark icon** in the bottom right corner to submit a GitHub issue!
>
> No issue is too big or too small!

Now that you know how the dashboard works, let's switch gears and focus on the sidebar on the
left-hand side of the screen!
