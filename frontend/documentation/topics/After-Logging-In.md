# After Logging In

After you complete logging in, you'll be redirected to a sidebar and an empty page:
![empty dashboard](emptydashboard.png)

From here, you can:
1. Select a site
2. Select a plot
3. Select a census

> A site is the overall region of the world where a plot is located. 
> For example, the plot `metrop2` is located in the `Panama` site

> A plot describes the overall location where censuses are conducted and is divided into quadrats.
> For example, the plot `metrop2` is divided into 25 quadrats.

> A census is a single period of time when data was collected, reviewed, and analyzed.

Once you've done this, the dashboard and sidebar will both change:
![sidebar after selecting site/plot/census](updatedsidebar.png)

You should see that the sidebar now contains a navigation menu with clickable menu links!
