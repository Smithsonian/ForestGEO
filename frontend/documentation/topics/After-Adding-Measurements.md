# After Adding Measurements

Once you have successfully uploaded your supporting data, measurements, and successfully
validated your data, you can proceed in a number of ways.

## Post-Validation Statistics

After you have populated the measurements page, you can navigate to the post-validation
statistics page to perform statistics calculations on your census.

### Interacting with the Post-Validation Statistics Page

After navigating to the page, you should see a table appear with a set of:

- SQL queries
- a brief explanation of their function
- historical data columns indicating:
  - the last time they were run
  - whether they were successful
  - what their successful run returned

Use the checkboxes to select the queries you want to run, and then click on the **Run
Statistics** button to run the queries. The queries should update momentarily.

You can also download or print the results of the queries by again selecting them via their
checkboxes and clicking on the **Download Statistics** or **Print Statistics** buttons.
