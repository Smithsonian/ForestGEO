# Data Submission and Updating

There are several different ways you can add data to a census, and some data does overlap across 
censuses. 

## Adding Supporting Data

### Direct submission

Let's use the stem codes page as an example: 
1. When you navigate to its data grid, you will see an **add row** button at the top of the grid. 
2. Clicking on it will generate a **single** empty row that can then be populated.
3. Once completed, click the save button to confirm and then submit your changes. 
4. The grid will reload and you should see your new row. 

### Bulk submission

Again, let's use the stem codes page as an example:
1. Click on the **Manual Entry Form** button to open the bulk data input interface
2. This will open a popup with a new grid, with buttons to add new rows, save, and submit.
3. Add rows as needed and ensure that you save your changes before submitting.
   1. Note: Bulk data input follows the same header format as file upload. Please ensure you 
      correctly enter your data.
4. The grid will reload and you should see your new rows.

### File upload

Again, let's use the stem codes page as an example:
1. Click on the **Upload** button to open the file upload interface
2. Follow the prompts to upload, review, and submit your file. 
   1. Note: your file should be in CSV format and correctly match the header format outlined in 
      the first page of the interface. 
3. After the upload completes, you should see your new rows in the grid. 

### Editing Existing Data

If needed, you can edit existing data by clicking on the pencil icon at the end of a row. The 
row will then switch to Edit mode, allowing you to make changes. Once completed, click the save 
icon to confirm and then submit your changes.

> deliberate choice to ensure that data is preserved as-is.

## Adding Measurements Data

Uploading measurements data follows the same process as uploading supporting data, with the 
exception that Direct Submission and Editing are **disabled**. Furthermore, addition of new rows 
will automatically run validation checks on the rows to ensure they are correct. Rows that pass 
validation will be highlighted green and have a checkmark icon, while rows that fail validation 
will be highlighted red and have an exclamation mark icon.
