# The Census Hub

The Census Hub is where measurements and measurement-related information can be found. There
are several links that will appear when you expand the Census Hub menu:

## View Data

This is the main data view for the current Site/Plot/Census selection. It's important to note
that this view will specifically filter ONLY for the census you've selected in the Sidebar!

> When you start a new census, this link will be disabled, with a yellow warning badge
> positioned on the icon. Hover over it to see why!

## Uploaded Files

Files you upload for the existing Plot/Census selection in the sidebar will be automatically
saved to a dedicated Azure storage container for your Plot-Census combination.

## View All Historical Data

This is where you can see the View Full Table view previously introduced by CTFSWeb. You should
be able to review all past historical data for your site and plot here.

## Validations

You can see a display of data validation checks that will be applied to the data you upload here!
If you have the appropriate permissions, you'll be able to add, edit, delete, or toggle
validations on/off.
