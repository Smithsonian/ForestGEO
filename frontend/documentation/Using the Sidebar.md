#### In order to use the app, you will need to use the Sidebar

Let's review the logged in screen, which demonstrates what you should see immediately after you've logged in:

> As you make selections, you'll see loading screens and additional options to navigate to -- like a choose-your-own-adventure!

## Sidebar -- Core Operations

### Selections:

There are a series of core selections that you'll need to make before the app is actually usable:

1. Site --> this refers to the name of the overall location where your plot or plots is located.

> [!tip]
> For example, for Mpala, the site is named Mpala!
>
> > [!warning]
> > Please note that for sites that only have 1 plot, the plot name and the site name will be the same!

2. Plot --> refers to the collection of censused quadrats.
3. Census --> this is a little more complicated:  
   Censuses have been organized by Plot Census Number (PCN), which denotes the overall census for a given plot. The CensusID (CID) value originally used is now used as a subunit of a PCN, to denote a date range where measurements were submitted for that PCN.

> This is an important distinction! Please make sure you keep this in mind as you use the website.
