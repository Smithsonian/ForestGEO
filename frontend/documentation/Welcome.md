Documentation hub started here -- being kept on Obsidian because it's an interesting medium that doesn't leave me
reliant on JetBrains (finite subscription).
Intended to be used as an all-purpose documentation resource: devs and non-devs alike.
Will focus on use cases and interaction instructions first, before any refining or cleanup occurs -- please excuse any
typos, grammatical errors, etc.
