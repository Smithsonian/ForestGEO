# How to add new UI element/component storybook

# you will need 3 different files for each component:

# file 1 Button.js - the component itself
# this file will return a function component

# file 2 Button.css - the base style for the component
# you can make different variations of the component using classes

# file 3 Button.stories.js - the component story
# need to use component story format:
  # add default export 
  # name exports - represents each story (each variation)



# to start the component explorer on port 6006:
# allows you to see all components on your storybook
  yarn storybook

# to run the frontend app on port 3000:
  yarn start
