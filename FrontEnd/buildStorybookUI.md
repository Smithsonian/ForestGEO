# What is Storybook?
We can use Storybook to *create components* or elements, an example of a component is a button, header, etc.

We can *create variations* of each component by using **stories**, an example of a variation is a blue button or a red button.

# How to run Storybook
### start the component explorer on port 6006:
  `yarn storybook`
 
 this allows you to see all components on your storybook

### run the frontend app on port 3000:
  `yarn start`

# How to add a new UI component with Storybook
