# CSS for Forest Geo App

For consistencyâ€™s sake through development of the app, CSS files should be created for styling of all
components and pages.

# For MUI

The only time inline styling should be used is for MUI components using sx props.
For instance, if desiring to use the primary color from the theme.ts file,
inline styling may be used with the sx prop.

Otherwise, regular CSS in the CSS file should be the default choice of styling.
