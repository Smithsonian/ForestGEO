## Azure Static Web Apps service
The project test app is currently deployed using Azure Static Web Apps service
and can be accessed at 

https://agreeable-wave-08a957210.1.azurestaticapps.net/

When we get an update on subscription we can use, the URL will be changed.
During the deployment process Azure automatically creates GitHub workflow file that defines CI/CD (Continuous integration/deployment). For example, when the code is updated and PR is created, GitHub automatically creates a copy of the app with the updated code and provides URL for that so it is easy to test the changes and compare updated app with the one in production.
